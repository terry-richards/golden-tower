## 1. Build Volume Fit

Target printer: **Bambu Lab P1S** (256 x 256 x 256 mm)

| Component | X (mm) | Y (mm) | Z (mm) | Fits? | Margin |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Standard Segment | 172.5 | 160.3 | 241.8 | YES | 14.2mm Z |
| Bottom Segment | 172.5 | 160.0 | 241.8 | YES | 14.2mm Z |
| Top Cap | 180.0 | 179.9 | 25.8 | YES | 76mm XY |

The segment Z extent of 241.8mm includes pocket protrusions extending below and above the base body. The male interlock adds 10mm above the 200mm body, and tilted pocket protrusions extend ~21mm below and ~21mm above the interlock connection plane. All components fit within the 256mm build volume.

## 2. Overhang Analysis

| Feature | Angle from Vertical | Max Limit | Needs Support? |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Outer cylinder wall | 0 deg | 55 deg | No |
| Pocket tilt | 20 deg | 55 deg | No |
| Pocket interior ceiling | ~20 deg | 55 deg | No |
| Female interlock bore ceiling | 90 deg (horizontal) | 55 deg | Bridging (13.3mm) |
| Supply tube bore | 0 deg | 55 deg | No |
| Male ring to outer wall step | 90 deg (horizontal) | 55 deg | **51mm overhang** |

### Critical Features

1. **Male ring to outer wall step**: At the top of each segment, the outer cylinder (r=80mm) terminates and the male ring (r=29mm) continues upward. This creates a 51mm inward horizontal step. When printing upright, this is a ceiling overhang that exceeds the 40mm bridge limit.

2. **Female interlock bore**: The annular pocket at the segment base (r=16mm to r=29.3mm) is a 13.3mm wide horizontal ceiling. Within the 40mm bridge limit -- self-supporting with bridging.

3. **Pocket interiors**: The pocket bores are tilted 20 deg from vertical. The upper surface of each tilted pocket creates a local overhang of ~20 deg from vertical. Well within the 55 deg limit.

## 3. Support Requirements

| Feature | Support Needed? | Assessment |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Female interlock bore | No (bridge) | 13.3mm span -- within 40mm bridge limit |
| Pocket interiors | No | 20 deg tilt self-supporting |
| Male ring step (top) | **YES** | 51mm horizontal step exceeds 40mm bridge limit |
| QD barb ridges | No | Small cones, self-supporting |
| Bayonet lugs | No | Printed on build plate |

### Recommendations

**Option A**: Print segments upside-down (male ring on bed). This eliminates the large overhang but places the female bore on top (open cavity, no support needed).

**Option B**: Add a chamfered/tapered transition from the outer wall to the male ring. A 55 deg chamfer from r=80 at z=SEGMENT_HEIGHT to r=29 at z=SEGMENT_HEIGHT+INTERLOCK_HEIGHT would make the feature self-supporting.

**Option C**: Accept supports at the male ring step. Clean-up required but functionally acceptable.

## 4. Material Estimate

Material: PETG (density 1.27 g/cm3), 15% infill general areas, 100% walls.

| Component | Mesh Volume (cm3) | Est. Print Mass (g) | Qty/Tower | Total (g) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Standard Segment | 373.1 | ~210 | 7 | 1,470 |
| Bottom Segment | 370.5 | ~208 | 1 | 208 |
| Top Cap | 71.0 | ~65 | 1 | 65 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **9 parts** | **~1,743g** |

Note: Printed mass is less than mesh volume x density because infill < 100%. Estimate assumes ~55% fill factor (perimeters + 15% infill + top/bottom solid layers).

**Filament requirement**: ~1.75 kg = approximately 2 standard 1kg spools of PETG.

## 5. Print Time Estimate

Settings: 0.2mm layer height, 60mm/s average, Bambu Lab P1S.

| Component | Height (mm) | Est. Time (hrs) |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Standard Segment | 242 | 8-12 |
| Bottom Segment | 242 | 8-12 |
| Top Cap | 26 | 1-2 |
| **Full tower (9 parts)** | | **~65-90 hours** |

## 6. Issues Summary

| # | Severity | Component | Issue |
|---|----------|-----------|-------|
| P1 | MAJOR | Segment | Top overhang from r=80 to r=29 at male ring creates 51mm horizontal step exceeding 40mm bridge limit. Needs chamfer, support, or inverted print orientation. |
| P2 | MINOR | All | Z height 241.8mm leaves only 14.2mm margin in 256mm build volume |
| P3 | MINOR | Bottom seg | QD barb below z=0 adds to total print height |

## Score

| Category | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Printability | 6/10 | 20% | 1.20 |

Score reflects: all parts fit build volume (good), all meshes watertight (good), most features self-supporting (good), but major overhang at male ring step needs resolution (drops score).
