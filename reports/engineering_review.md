## 1. Wall Thickness Analysis

| Surface | Design Value | Minimum Spec | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Outer shell | 2.0 mm (WALL_THICKNESS) | 1.6 mm (2 perimeters) | PASS |
| Supply tube wall | 2.0 mm (OD 32/ID 28) | 1.6 mm | PASS |
| Pocket cup wall | 2.0 mm | 1.6 mm | PASS |
| Drip tray floor | 5.0 mm (DRIP_TRAY_DEPTH) | 1.6 mm | PASS |
| Water-contact surfaces | 2.4 mm (top cap base) | 2.4 mm (3 perimeters) | PASS |

**Assessment**: All wall thicknesses meet or exceed the 1.6 mm minimum. Water-contact surfaces in the top cap use 2.4 mm as specified. The drip tray floor at 5.0 mm is more than adequate. However, the outer shell wall is only 2.0 mm -- while this meets min spec, water-contact outer walls should ideally be 2.4 mm.

## 2. Water Flow Analysis

### Flow Path
```
Pump -> QD barb (ID 9.5mm) -> Supply tube bore (ID 28mm) -> Up through all segments
  -> Top cap deflector (30 deg cone) -> Water drips/flows outward
  -> Contacts pocket exteriors and drip trays -> Drains back to reservoir
```

### Segment-by-Segment

| Segment | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|
| QD barb -> tube bore | QD bore (9.5mm) transitions to tube bore (28mm). Good expansion ratio, no restrictions. |
| Supply tube (ID 28mm) | Adequate for 1-4 L/min target flow. At 2 L/min, velocity = 0.054 m/s -- very low, no pressure issues. |
| Top cap deflector | 30 deg cone angle redirects water outward. No explicit water distribution channels to direct flow to specific pockets. |
| Pocket drainage | Pockets tilt 20 deg outward -- water drains naturally. Drip tray floor captures overflow. |
| Drip tray | 5mm floor at base of each segment. No explicit slope or drain channel cut into geometry. |

### Issues

- **MAJOR**: The top cap deflector is a solid cone -- water hits the cone and flows outward, but there is no mechanism to direct water into specific pockets or distribute it evenly. Outermost pockets receive most water, inner surfaces underserved.
- **MAJOR**: The drip tray has no explicit drain channels. DRIP_TRAY_SLOPE (3 deg) and DRIP_TRAY_DRAIN_WIDTH (6mm) parameters exist in tower_params.py but are not implemented in the geometry. Water pooling on the flat tray floor is likely.
- **MINOR**: No O-ring groove implemented at segment joints. SEGMENT_ORING parameters exist but aren't used. Interlock seams will leak.

## 3. Interlock Strength Analysis

| Feature | Value | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Male ring OR | 29.0 mm | Good -- substantial ring around supply tube (OD 16mm) |
| Ring height | 10.0 mm | Adequate engagement depth for twist-lock |
| Clearance | 0.3 mm | Standard for FDM printing tolerance |
| Key tab | 3.0 x 8.0 x 10.0 mm | Small but functional for alignment |
| Key slot | 3.6 x 8.6 x 10.0 mm | Proper clearance around key |

**Assessment**: The male ring has a radial wall of 29 - 16 = 13mm (from supply tube OD to ring edge). This is substantial. With 10mm engagement depth, the interlock provides good shear resistance. The alignment key forces correct 52.524 deg rotational orientation.

**MINOR**: No explicit locking feature (ramp, detent, or bayonet) -- segments could slide apart vertically under their own weight. Consider adding a locking lug or interference fit.

## 4. Mesh Quality

| Component | Volume (mm3) | Watertight | Extents (mm) |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| segment.stl | 373,098 | YES | 172.5 x 160.3 x 241.8 |
| bottom_segment.stl | 370,513 | YES | 172.5 x 160.0 x 241.8 |
| top_cap.stl | 70,958 | YES | 180.0 x 179.9 x 25.8 |

All meshes are manifold, watertight, and have consistent normals. No degenerate faces. All 39 automated tests pass.

## 5. Issues Summary

| # | Severity | Component | Issue |
|---|----------|-----------|-------|
| E1 | MAJOR | Top cap | No water distribution channels -- uneven pocket irrigation |
| E2 | MAJOR | Segment | Drip tray drain channels not implemented (params exist, geometry doesn't) |
| E3 | MINOR | Segment | O-ring groove not implemented -- interlock will leak |
| E4 | MINOR | Segment | Outer shell uses 2.0mm not 2.4mm for water-contact surface |
| E5 | MINOR | Segment | No vertical locking feature on interlock -- segments can slide apart |

## Scores

| Category | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Water Flow | 5/10 | 20% | 1.00 |
| Structural Integrity | 7/10 | 15% | 1.05 |
